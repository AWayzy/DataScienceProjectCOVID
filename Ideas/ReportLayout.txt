    intro

    Perform PCA on data
        By state - include total cases, deaths, create a mortality ratio variable, vaccine deployment if accessible, 
        
    Talk about limitations of mathematical epidemiology, why you cannot fit a simple model to predict cases.
    
    Maybe LDA to predict if someone will die? Given age group, pre-existing conditions, etc
