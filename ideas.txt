IDEAS:

FIT A MODEL TO PREDICT COVID CASES! WITH EARLY 80% OF PANDEMIC AND TEST WITH 20%! USE VACCINE INFO

RUN PCA ON IT TO DETERMINE THE STATES THAT HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST

ANALYZE MORTALITY RATES AMONGST DIFFERENT GROUPS, BRING IN THE STATES AND DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE STATES

MEASURE CONFIRMED CASES W PROBABLE CASES TO GET A RATE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE CDC STUDIES



When fully vaccinated, you are safe approx 5-6 weeks after first dose (CITE SOURCE!!). Therefore, offset by 5 weeks pfizer and 6 weeks moderna. 


IMPORTANT FOR HANDLING INFO ON VACCINES!!
New weekly allocations of doses are posted every Tuesday. Beginning the following Thursday, states can begin ordering doses from that week’s new allocation of 1st doses. Beginning two weeks (Pfizer) or three weeks (Moderna) from the following Sunday, states can begin ordering doses from that week’s new allocation of 2nd doses. After doses are ordered by states, shipments begin the following Monday. The entire order may not arrive in one shipment or on one day, but over the course of the week.
Second doses are opened up for orders on Sundays, at the appropriate interval two or three weeks later according to the manufacturer’s label, with shipments occurring after jurisdictions place orders.

+ 1 week for shipment. First doses 

Compare states with highest levels of vaccine hesitancy to data on per state cases

Involve news / politics, per state bases, etc for levels of covid amongst things like shutdowns and reopenings


Note: should not attempt to train a model to predict covid cases - epidemiology is a complicated science, and any model would likely be too naive to be correct. SEIR model, etc is good.
